        <article>
            <p>Curious, determined and ambitious, Elijah Kwaku Adutwum Boateng has made it his mission to utilize
                computing and intelligent machines to address real-world challenges. From early collaborations with
                researchers at Ashesi University and University of Ghana, the Ashesi Class of 2023 alum has continually
                drawn on the technical foundation he built at the university to solve day-to-day challenges that demand
                both theory and practical insight. His capstone project on facial recognition systems marked a turning
                point in his academic career, demonstrating his ability to turn academic concepts into functional,
                real-world solutions. Driven by discomfort, curiosity, and a commitment to meaningful innovation, Elijah
                continues to deepen his knowledge in interactive machine intelligence as an Intelligent Computing
                masters student at Ashesi University.</p>

            <p>Elijah's journey into the world of intelligence computer science (ICS) began after graduating from Ashesi
                University in 2023 with a degree in computer science. During his University trajectory, he was
                privileged to work at the University of Ghana and Ashesi University as a research aide, usually being
                assigned to foundational tasks, including literature reviews and data interpretation. Post his
                graduation from Ashesi in 2023, he was employed by the university as a faculty intern in the provost's
                office. He did not neglect his love for the world of machine intelligence, during his employment as a
                faculty intern, he worked alongside Dr. Govender on research projects.</p>

            <p>According to Elijah, working with the Academic Affairs and Professors, especially, Dr. Govender taught
                him how to be patient and meticulous when undertaking research projects, and not necessarily rush into
                conclusions. He also learned that, though capstone projects generally force people into deadlines, it is
                important to be innovative and circumspect while allowing room to explore. Now, even under time
                pressure, Elijah ideates quickly and frequently, enabling him to see many results from which he
                identifies the most efficient approach within a short time.</p>

            <p>During this time, he was exposed to a plethora of topics under machine intelligence, such as how Code can
                interact with real-world systems and transforming abstract algorithms into solutions that address
                concrete challenges. That’s where he realized that sitting in front of the computer, just typing “one’s”
                and ” zero’s”, “input” and “print,” would isolate his work behind screens, hijacking both worldly impact
                and his ability to engage physically with communities. Thus, he decided to offer ICS as a concatenation
                of theoretical foundations, research experience, and strong applicative orientation.</p>

            <p>Early in his academic journey, Elijah was introduced to the world of research as he worked on research
                projects with professors from the University of Ghana and Ashesi. He was tasked with the development of
                literature reviews, data collection and summarisation and with the interpretation of basic statistics.
                In his final year at Ashesi, he found that the research knowledge he had accumulated from the tertiary
                institutions had provided him with the prerequisite knowledge to work independently and efficiently on
                the research for his capstone titled “Facial Recognition Using Multiple Constraints with Application to
                Attendance Management”.</p>

            <p>Taking inspiration from Dr. Lumens’ work on facial recognition, Elijah sought to enhance the existing
                model which he observed functioned effectively but in isolation across different constraints, thus he
                aimed to integrate these individual strengths into a single, more efficient model. His research focused
                on three major components. The first component he improved was detection, he addressed lighting
                challenges by improving the system’s ability to accurately locate faces under varying lighting
                conditions. Secondly, he addressed feature extraction by improving the visibility and alignment of key
                facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, by utilizing Google’s FaceNet which is a pretrained
                model used to generate robust feature embeddings even when parts of the face are partially obscured.
                Finally he improved the classification stage in the model through the employment of distance-based
                methods and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to distinguish between individuals faces with higher
                precision and accuracy. Although the system did not explicitly account for rapid, real-time changes in
                lighting and pose, his final model still achieved an accuracy of approximately 95–96%.</p>

            <p>Building on his capstone research, Elijah is exploring the intersection of vision and language, working
                on ‘language-vision models’ which are equipped with vision to both see and understand. While he
                acknowledged the existence of GPT-based systems that can perform similar tasks, he stated that they are
                often expensive and inaccessible thus motivating him to develop cheaper, smaller and more efficient
                models capable of running locally. He seeks to build a model that can make meaningful contributions to
                healthcare in Ghana, referring to his model as a “low-cost, hospital in your pocket” that can listen,
                see, and reduce consultation times and provide accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on his journey so far, Elijah emphasized the importance of patience as a virtue in research.
                He learnt the importance of meticulousness and careful observation, from esteemed professors like Dr.
                Govender and Dr. Jumens who taught him that thoughtful iteration and attention to detail often lead to
                more meaningful and effective solutions. Although sometimes challenging to practice, the value of
                patience and meticulousness have allowed him to iterate frequently, explore multiple outcomes to
                identify the most efficient approaches.</p>

            <p>Aside from patience, Elijah highlighted that his ‘eureka moments’ mainly arose from moments of discomfort
                and frustration. For instance his capstone facial recognition project was birthed in the middle of the
                night when his phone could not recognize his face and failed to unlock. Problems like these piqued his
                curiosity causing him to ponder until solutions began to surface. He emphasizes that anyone can identify
                problems by observing what doesn’t work, for him, this reflection has become a key source of innovation,
                with ideas quickly taking shape in his mind.</p>

            <p>As a student currently pursuing a master’s degree in ICS, Elijah’s aim now is how to find missing persons
                efficiently and how delivery systems could automate connections instead of requiring calls. He hopes to
                achieve this by building upon his face recognition project he worked on as his final year capstone
                project.</p>
